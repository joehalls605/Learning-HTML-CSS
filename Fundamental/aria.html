In HTML, ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes are a set of attributes that can be added to HTML elements to improve accessibility for users with disabilities. 
ARIA attributes help in making web content more accessible to assistive technologies like screen readers. 

Some common ARIA attributes include:
aria-labelledby: Indicates the ID of another element that serves as the label for the current element.
aria-describedby: Indicates the ID of another element that provides a description for the current element.
aria-hidden: Indicates whether an element is visible or hidden to assistive technologies.
aria-disabled: Indicates whether an element is disabled or not.
aria-expanded: Indicates whether a collapsible element such as an accordion is expanded or collapsed.
aria-checked: Indicates the state of a checkbox or radio button.
aria-selected: Indicates whether an option in a listbox or dropdown menu is selected.
aria-controls: Indicates the IDs of elements controlled by the current element.
aria-haspopup: Indicates whether an element has a popup menu or dialog.
aria-live: Indicates that content of an element is live-updated and should be communicated to the user by an assistive technology.
aria-atomic: Indicates whether the entire content of an element should be updated when changes occur, or only the changed portion.
